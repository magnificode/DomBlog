                    <p>Utilizing the client's awesome work as the focal point, we were able to provide a slick looking way to showcase their work. Through the Vimeo API we were able to automatically pull titles, descriptions and video embeds directly into the site. All the client had to do was add a vimeo ID to the Wordpress backend. This also gave the user the opportunity to immediately see what the cleint had to offer through the imagery and video content.</p>

With Wordpress' Sticky Post functionality we were able to give the client the opportunity to select specific works and feature them separately. By utilizing SVG maps we were able to help users from all around the world see that the client took work near them, giving the site more exposure globally.</p>
